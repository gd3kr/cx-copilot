Some things to keep in mind when using sections: ,"We recommend using sections for publishing new content rather than displaying static resources or information, for which recommended links is a better feature.

"What is an alias record?",An alias record is a special type of record that only a few registrars support that allows you to map a domain to another domain (very similar to CNAME) but crucially allows you to map the “root” domain to something else. Practically this matters because it allows someone to set up their custom domain with us as e.g. example.com as opposed to www.example.com
"How do I configure a CNAME with my registrar?","Check with your domain registrar to configure your CNAME. Below are a few helpful docs for common registrars to get you started. 

Google domains: Create a CNAME record
GoDaddy: Add a CNAME record
Namecheap: How to create a CNAME record
Domain.com: How to update a CNAME
DreamHost: Adding a CNAME
Bluehost: What is a CNAME?
Hover: Managing DNS records
Dynadot: How do I create a CNAME?
Cloudflare: If you have registered your domain through Cloudflare, make sure that the “Proxy status” on your CNAME record is set to “DNS only”. The orange cloud icon in the CNAME record row should be grey, not orange."
"Does my Substack URL have to include www?","When you buy a domain, the name you buy– such as “example.com” or “example.co.uk”– is called the “root domain”. Your domain registrar will also allow you to use subdomains, such as “www.example.com” or “blog.example.co.uk”."
"Why does Substack require ""www"" in my newsletter URL?","Some domain registrars, including GoDaddy and Google Domains, only allow CNAME records to point from a subdomain and not from a root domain (this is sometimes called “CNAME flattening”). For example, on Godaddy, you won’t be able to use example.com for your Substack publication, but you will be able to use www.example.com.

If you've registered your domain with one of these registrars, we require a subdomain for your Substack.

Formats that work:

www.example.com
newsletter.example.com

Format that won't work:

example.com"
Is there a workaround?,"After setting up a CNAME for your newsletter, the next step is to set up a 301 redirect that basically forwards the non-www version of your custom domain to the www URL.

example.com → www.example.com"
"Can I make a private Substack publication?","A private Substack publication is a secret publication you can host alone or invite others to join.

To select a different image from your post for the preview, hover over the thumbnail or click ""Upload New"".

Tip: For photos to appear in the social preview, we recommend the dimensions to be at least 420x300 pixels (or larger)."
"Why does it say ""Post too long"" in the post editor?","If you draft a post and see a ""Post too long for email"" message, this means that it just may appear as clipped or truncated in a reader's email inbox.

While there isn't a word count or length restriction on Substack posts, some email providers like Gmail will truncate messages exceeding 102KB. You'll see this message in the post editor after you've exceeded Gmail's size limit.

You'll still be able to publish the post.

Tip: If the newsletter is truncated in an email, readers can click on ""View entire message"" and they'll be able to view the entire post in their email app."
"How do I see replies to an email I've sent out?","If someone replies an email newsletter, you'll receive it in your inbox, just like a regular email.

Your Substack alias redirects emails to whatever email address is linked to your publication.

If you'd like to change the email address linked to your publication, follow these steps.

1. Log into your Substack account and click on your profile icon. Select Settings from the menu.

2. On the next page, select ""Edit"" next to your email address.

The changes you make will only be reflected in the web version of the post.

If you want to send a corrected or updated post to your mailing list again, you’ll need to create a new post."
"If I import a post from elsewhere, will it be emailed out to my list?","If you've imported posts to your Substack publication from elsewhere, you can email them to your subscribers.

Imported posts will appear as a web post on your Posts page once they've completed importing to your publication.

How do I set up my Stripe account to start receiving payments?,"Ready to take the next step and turn on paid posts on your publication? This guide covers exactly the steps you need to take with Stripe– from linking your receiving bank account to managing payouts.

In this guide

Connecting to Stripe

Managing your Stripe account

Frequently asked questions"
Connecting to Stripe,"It takes just minutes to set up your Stripe account. Before you get started, Stripe will ask for information about your business and customer support details.

Customer support details such as a phone number and address may appear on subscriber invoices and their card statements.

Tip:You can hide the public customer support details on Stripe but for extra privacy, you can set up a Google Voice number and/or a virtual mailbox. 

1. Head to your Settings and click on Connect with Stripe which can be found in the ""Set up paid subscriptions"" section.

2. Enter the requested information such as a registered business address and personal details.

Note: If you don't have a business address, you can use a home address.

Depending on the country you reside in, Stripe will tailor what required details they need in order to verify your identity and meet requirements from regulators. 

3. Link your bank account using your online banking credentials or manually add your routing and account number for payments (Stripe refers to these as payouts).

4. Provide customer support details that help subscribers recognize the charges on their credit card statement.

Tip: A statement descriptor explain charges or payments on bank statements. Make it easy for a subscriber to recognize!

5. Once you submit your information, you'll be directed back to your Settings page on Substack where you can set up your subscription plans. "
Managing your Stripe Account,"All payouts for paid subscriptions can be viewed on your Stripe account.

How to access Stripe

You can access your Stripe account anytime by selecting the Connected account link under
""Subscription plans"" on your Settings page.

How to view payouts

Once you're on Stripe, navigate to the left dashboard and select Payouts."
Are there any fees?,"If you add paid subscriptions, we charge 10% and there is a credit card fee charged by Stripe."
How long do payouts take?,"Payments usually arrive in your bank account within 48 hours of each transaction; you can read more information from our payment processor here.

The first payout for every new Stripe account takes 7-14 days to deposit in your bank account."
Will I be notified once a payout is on its way?,"Yes! You can set your payouts to be sent on a daily or weekly basis. Once a payout is on its way, Stripe will notify you via email of the amount and the estimated deposit date to your bank account."
What can I do if Stripe isn't supported in the country I reside in?,"Stripe is our sole payments provider and we rely on many of their features to make Substack work and their entire feature-set may not be available in every country.

As a workaround you may consider using Stripe Atlas which helps you set up a company and bank account in the US and is designed to work with Stripe."
Can I hide my support phone number and address?,"If you'd like to keep your support phone number and address private, navigate to Account Details in your Stripe Settings.

Toggle these two sections from ""On"" to ""Off"":"
Who do I contact if I need help with payouts?,"Have a question about your Stripe account? Click on ""Contact Support"" here where you'll be able to chat, call, or email Stripe Support."
Stripe asked me to verify my domain. What should I do?,"Substack's third-party payment processor, Stripe, is required to verify that their account holders are operating with valid addresses and contact information. They may reach out to you to verify your domain.

Failure to verify your domain can result in billing for your publication being temporarily paused, so if you're asked to do so, we recommend providing the information below as soon as possible via the prompts in your Stripe dashboard: 

Email Address (within Substack domain): support@substack.com 

Support Website: support.substack.com

Privacy Policy: substack.com/privacy 

Terms of Service: substack.com/tos

You may want to contact Stripe Support for specific questions about the domain verification process, but you can always submit a support request here to Substack if you have additional questions or concerns. "
Why is there a difference between my Substack GARR and Stripe MRR?,"Stripe calculates recurring revenue differently from Substack, especially when it comes to subscriptions that have timely coupons (eg ""33% off for your first year""). Stripe considers the recurring value of those subscriptions to be their eventual full price rather than their current 33% off price. If the majority of your subscriptions came with discounts, the gap between what Stripe reports and what we report may be particularly large.
"
How do I set up a paid publication?,"After creating a publication:

1. Sign into your Subtstack account and navigate to your publication's Settings page.

2. Scroll down to ""Payments"" and click the button that says ""Connect with Stripe"".

3. You'll be taken to Stripe's website, where you'll fill out required details to start receiving payments. Learn more here on what information Stripe requires.

4. After you've returned to the Settings page, set a price for your monthly and yearly subscriptions.

Note: At this time, we do not offer a ""yearly only"" subscription plan.

You can also offer a Founding Member plan. This is an annual plan that lets readers subscribe at any amount higher than the monthly and yearly plans. Learn more here on how to set up a subscription plan for Founding Members.

5. When you're ready, check the “Enable payments” box, which will make your paid subscriptions go live. Your readers won't see that you offer paid subscriptions until you check this box."
How do payouts work on Substack?,Payments usually arrive in your bank account within 48 hours of each transaction; you can read more information from our payment processor here.
Can I link multiple publications to the same Stripe account?,"You can't, but Stripe makes it easy to manage multiple accounts, and you can have the money go to the same bank account."
How does paid subscriptions work in the Substack app?,"At this time, new readers can only become paid subscribers on the web.

However, they can easily subscribe as a free subscriber on the Substack app. Once they subscribe to your publication on the app, they’ll get an email confirmation with upgrade options and a link to your publication's subscription page that they can access from the web just like normal.
"
How do I make changes to a reader's subscription?,"Navigate to your Subscribers tab and locate the subscriber by entering their email address in the Search bar:

Click on the three dots next to their name and select ""Edit Subscription"":

For a paying subscriber

Turn off auto-renew: their paid subscription will end after their current billing period.
Cancel subscription: cancel their subscription to issue a prorated or full refund and they'll be downgraded to a free subscriber.
To learn more about Substack's refund policy, read this article.
Remove from email list

Removing a free or paid subscriber from your email list will stop the subscriber from receiving any emails from your publication moving forward. For paying subscribers, their subscription will be canceled with a prorated refund."
How do I cancel a subscription and issue a refund for a paid subscriber?,"To cancel a paid subscription and issue a refund, navigate to your  Subscribers tab.

Locate the paid subscriber by entering their email address in the Search bar:

Click on the three dots next to their name and select ""Edit Subscription"":

You'll then have the option to cancel their subscription with a pro-rated or full refund.

Once the paid subscriber is canceled, the reader will be notified about via email about their refund and be downgraded to a free subscriber. They'll receive free posts but won’t have access to paid-only posts or comments on paid-only posts.

To learn more about Substack's refund policy, read this article.

Important: Publishers should issue all refunds through the Substack Subscribers dashboard. Refunds issued through the Stripe dashboard will include Substack's 10% fee. Should a reader who has already canceled contact you to request a refund, please ask them to fill out this form."
A subscriber told me they aren't getting my emails. What should I do?,"There can be a variety of reasons of why a subscriber isn't receiving your Substack emails. In most cases, your emails may have unintentionally been marked as Spam.

We recommend sharing this page with your reader to help them get started with receiving your newsletter again!"
"Someone subscribed to my publication and had a payment failure, but they still got a success page on Substack. Is this a bug?","If the subscriber's payment fails, we'll automatically retry and email the subscriber on your behalf, asking them to update their payment method. Our payment processor Stripe will generally retry payments 3 times automatically before a paid subscription is canceled.

If you'd like to reach out to subscribers with payment failures, we've seen that personal outreach from the author can further improve the customer's willingness to update their card or call their bank if they're experiencing issues. But even if you don't do anything, don't worry, we'll keep trying on your behalf."
Readers are saying that they're blocked from paying to subscribe. Why?,"If your readers are being blocked from paying to subscribe to your newsletter, it's possible that:

Our payments processor, Stripe, may have flagged your account and blocked it from accepting payments.

Payments may not be supported in the country you reside in.

A reader's bank may think the charge is fraudulent and have blocked the transaction. We recommend they contact their bank as a next step and ask their bank to allow the charge to clear."
A guide to Substack metrics,"On your Substack dashboard, there's three main places you'll want to check to see how your publication is doing: Posts, Subscribers, and Stats. 

Posts

The Posts page tells you about individual posts you've published and where your readers came from.

Total views: The number of views on your post, similar to page views. They include both web, email, or the Substack app. 

Free subscription: The number of people who subscribed to your email list from that post.

Paid subscription: The number of people who signed up for a paid subscription from that post.

Shares: The number of people who clicked “Share” from that post.

Recipients: The number of unique people who received an email or Substack app notification about this post. 

Open rate: The percentage of people who viewed this post after receiving an email or Substack app notification about it.

Link clicks: The percentage of openers who clicked a given link in your post and the total click count.

Traffic sources: The top traffic sources that readers found a post from.

Subscribers

The Subscribers dashboard tells you about who’s signed up to your publication and how it's growing.

All subscribers: Includes free and paid subscribers.

Paid subscribers: The number of paying subscribers on your list. This includes gifts, complimentary, and free trial subscriptions. To see a more detailed breakdown, click the ""Paid subscribers"" tab on the graph, which will show you paid subscribers, comps, gifts, and free trials.

Gross annualized revenue: How much money you make per year, before Substack’s fees and credit card transaction fees (charged by Stripe). This figure is annualized, meaning that we look at your revenue at any given time and figure out what it would look like over the course of 12 months, assuming the mix of monthly and annual subscriptions remains constant. 

For publications with paid subscriptions enabled

The Paid Subscribers Growth chart helps you identify patterns in new paid subscribers, upgrades from free to paid, downgrades from paid, and expirations.

New subscribers refers to the number of individuals who were not free subscribers when they purchased a paid subscription on the specified date.

Existing subscribers upgrading from free refers to the number of individuals who were free subscribers when they purchased a paid subscription on the specified date.

Unsubscribes refers to the number of subscribers who unsubscribed from the publication on the specified date. Users who unsubscribe will still have paid access and be counted as a paid subscriber until their existing subscription expires.

Expirations refers to the number of subscribers who had previously unsubscribed and have now lost their paid access on the specified date. Expired subscribers may either downgrade to a free subscription or churn off completely.

Stats

The Stats page displays metrics for up to five categories: Traffic, Emails, Unsubscribes, Network, and Recommendations. The Unsubscribes and Network tabs are only visible for paid publications. 

Traffic
The Total traffic section tells you about the sum of all visits to your publication across platforms. You can see a 30 day, 90 day, or all time view.

Top sources shows where visitors came from and and how many subscribed. 

Visitors: The number of visitors who've been to your Substack (includes any post, not just your homepage).

Source: Where your visitors came from, also known as referral traffic. 

Under your referral traffic, if you see ""about"" or ""post"" in parentheses, such as ""facebook.com (post)"", it means your visitors came to that type of page on your Substack (e.g. your About page or a post you’ve published). Other websites can pass their own referral information through links, however, so not everything you see in parentheses is something that we track.

Emails

The Emails section provides a table of data for every post you send out, including the title, send date, audience, number of email deliveries and opens, open rate, free and paid subscriptions in 1 day, likes, comments, and shares.

By default, the table is sorted by most recent posts first, but you can sort it by different criteria  by clicking on the relevant column header. For example, to see your posts with the highest open rate, click the “Open Rate” header and it will sort from highest to lowest. Click the same header again, and you will see your posts sorted from lowest to highest open rate instead. 

Unsubscribes

If you have paid subscriptions, the Unsubscribes section provides you with a list of reasons why previous paid subscribers chose to unsubscribe from your publication. Your unsubscribe stats also include their emails and unsubscribe dates.

Network

If you have paid subscriptions, the Network section tells you how many of your paid subscribers came via the Substack network. The Substack publication and payment ecosystem makes it simple for readers to find and subscribe to their favorite publications.

The chart and table break down your paid subscribers into four categories based on how they came to your publication:

Substack platform features: Readers who subscribed as a direct result of Substack’s platform features, such as leaderboards, recommendations, or promotions.

Substack saved credit cards: Readers who could subscribe to your publication in only one click because they already had a payment method on file with Substack.

Substack existing accounts: Readers who could more easily subscribe to your publication because they already had a Substack account.

Imported accounts: Readers who you imported.

New accounts: Readers who came directly to your publication.

If you have Podcasts enabled, learn more here about your Podcast dashboard."
Changes to your Substack Gross Annualized Revenue,We’ve recently made some adjustments on how we calculate your publication’s GAR which you may have noticed on your Subscriber dashboard.
What causes my GAR to change?,"If you or a paid subscriber have made changes to their subscription, this can affect your publication's GAR.

The following subscription changes are now recognized differently.

Extending a subscription period

A reader's $10/month subscription is ending on 1/31 but you've extended their subscription on 1/20 for 7 days at no cost to them.

Previous GAR calculation: The GAR for this reader would drop to $0 on 1/20 and be $0 until 1/27. On 1/28, the GAR would increase back to $10 until 2/7 (the original end date plus the extension period).
New GAR calculation: The GAR for this reader will stay $10 until the original end date on 1/31 and on 2/1 (when the extension starts) the GAR will drop to $0 until 2/7.
A refund occurs

A reader subscribes to a $10/month plan on 1/1 but cancels their subscription and you issue a refund on 1/10.

Previous GAR calculation: Prior to the refund on 1/10, the reader GAR would've been $10 between 1/1-1/9. Once a refund is processed, the GAR value would be retroactively changed to $0 between 1/1-1/9.

New GAR calculation: The reader GAR will be $10 between 1/1-1/9. Processing the refund will not affect historical numbers and the GAR value between 1/1-1/9 will remain $10. This will drop to $0 once the refund is processed.
Changes in the exchange rate

A reader subscribes to a plan on 1/1 and is charged in euros when the rate is 1 euro= 1.1 USD. They cancel their subscription and are refunded on 1/10 when the exchange rate is 1.2.

Previous GAR calculation: The refund’s USD value would be calculated using the exchange rate from the date the subscription was purchased. In this example, the value would be 1.1.

New GAR calculation: The refund’s USD value will be calculated using the exchange rate from the date the subscription is refunded. In this example, the value will be 1.2.
A reader changes their plan mid-subscription

A reader's $10/month subscription is ending on 1/31 but they upgrade to a $100/year plan on 1/20. 

Previous GAR calculation: The GAR for their original plan would continue to be counted until the end date on 1/31. The GAR for the new plan would also be counted after 1/20. The total GAR for this subscription would be $110 between 1/20-1/31.

New GAR calculation: The original plan will stop being included in the GAR once the reader changes their plan and only the new plan will be included. The GAR for this subscription will be $10 between 1/1-1/19 and increase to $100 on 1/20."
Where can I see how readers got to my Substack post?,"When logged into your Substack account, head to your Posts tab and click on the down arrow next to each individual post.

Here, you'll find information on where readers of that particular post came from:"
What does each traffic source mean?,"Email- Your post was sent as a newsletter and opened and viewed in an email sent from your publication.

Direct- When a reader types your publication URL directly into the browser and clicks on your post or when there's an unknown source such as when a reader is using a web browser anonymously.

Other- Sources that account for <1% of views will appear as ""Other"".

Popular sites- If you or other readers shares your post on social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc), we'll display the site domain where readers clicked on the link and landed on your Substack post."

"
What is the meaning of each source on my Stats page?,"Your Stats tab will display metrics around monthly visitors and the sources from which they came from. To learn more about what each source means, please see below.
 
Direct:
- When someone types in your URL directly into the browser and lands on your publication
- When someone who is using a web browser anonymously lands on your publication
- When someone accesses your publication via email
 
Visitors:
- The number of people who visited your publication from the related source (i.e. 36 people came from Facebook and landed on your site)
 
Free Signups:
- The number of people who signed up for a free subscription from the related source (i.e. 9 people from Facebook signed up for free)
 
Subscribed:
- The number of people who signed up for a paid subscription from the related source (i.e. 0 people from Facebook signed up for a paid subscription)
 
When we send an email with a link, we'll add a tag to that link so we can track where traffic is coming from.
 
Direct (CTA):
- This means someone clicked on a CTA (call to action) from an email and landed on your publication

Direct (Substack):
- This means that someone clicked on a CTA (call to action) from Substack.com and landed on your publication
 
Substack Network:
-If you have paid subscriptions, the Network section tells you how many of your paid subscribers came via the Substack network. The Substack publication and payment ecosystem makes it simple for readers to find and subscribe to their favorite publications."
"How are ""Opens"" captured?","Substack detects opens by watching users load the images in their messages. Often this happens when the user clicks an email, but sometimes images can load in previews, or even be eagerly loaded by email clients for messages at the top of a user's mailbox. In addition, users can change their mailer settings to decline to load images or read text-only versions of the messages that don't load images at all.
 
Each email sent by Substack is marked with its intended recipient. We track opens by the intended recipient, not by the email messages themselves, so a reader who forwards their email to a friend will appear as a single user, opening a message twice.
 
The ""open rate"" we show in the interface is the proportion of intended recipients who have opened the email. Below the open rate we show the absolute number of opens, but an individual opening the same email many times (or sending it to their friends) may count for multiple entries in that absolute number."
How do Substack app reads show up in my Stats?,"When a reader opens your post in the Substack app, it'll count the same way that an email open counts in your Stats. "
What happens to my email list for readers who read in the Substack app?,"You will always own your readers’ email addresses and be able to export them at any time if you wish. When a new reader subscribes to you from the app, you’ll get their email address just like normal and be able to see their details on your Subscribers tab on the Substack.com."
Can subscribers listen to a voiceover on a podcast player?,"If you add a voiceover to a new post, you can select whether you'd like that voiceover post to appear on podcast players.

Make sure that:

You have a podcast on Substack set up.
You've submitted your podcast RSS feed to external podcast players like Apple Podcasts.
You create a new post and not a new episode on your Posts page.
Once you've inserted a voiceover and are finished with the draft post, click on Continue.

Next to ""Add voiceover to podcast RSS feed"" click on the toggle. A colored toggle will indicate that once published, this voiceover post will be pushed to podcast players.

Note: If you've selected the post to go to everyone, it will go to both your public podcast RSS feed and paid private feeds. If the post is only for paying subscribers, it will only go to their unique private podcast feed."
How do I create a preview of a paid podcast episode for free listeners?,"If your podcast episode is intended for paid subscribers, you can add a customized version of the audio to your post so that free listeners can listen to a preview.

On your Writer dashboard, select ""New episode"".

On the draft episode post, select ""Click to add audio"" and a new dashboard will appear on the right. Check the box next to ""Add free version"" and upload a customized version of your audio file or record your own audio. You can let your free listeners know that this is a paid episode and to hear more, they can upgrade to a paid subscription. 

After the free version of the audio has been uploaded, you can listen to the audio for paid subscribers or the audio for free listeners. Paid subscribers will only be presented with the original audio that you first uploaded to the post.

Once you're ready to make your post live, select ""Continue"" and ensure on your Publish page that the audience for the post is set to ""Paid subscribers only"".

If you've selected to send the post via email and the Substack app inbox, check the box next to ""Free subscribers""."
How does my podcast episode look like to listeners?,"On podcast players:

Since only paid subscribers can listen to paid episodes via their private RSS feed (except for Spotify who doesn't allow private RSS feeds), free listeners can click on an episode that has a free preview and listen to the customized version you've uploaded.

In the show notes, we'll let them know that they're listening to a free preview of a paid episode and link to your Substack publication.

Note: The title that appears on the podcast episode is what you've entered as the title of your post.

In an email newsletter:

When free listeners receive your email newsletter, they'll be able to click on ""Listen to preview"" and be sent to the web version of your post on a new browser. They'll also see part of your episode details and then be prompted to become a paying subscriber in order to listen to the complete episode.

On the Substack app:

Free listeners can tap on a post and listen to a free preview of the podcast episode directly on the Substack app. If they'd like to upgrade their subscription to become a paid subscriber, they can do so on the web version of Substack.com."
What artwork appears for my Substack podcast?,"When you create a podcast on Substack, you'll need to upload an image. You can think of this logo like branding for your podcast that'll appear in podcast players like Apple and Spotify. 

The default image is a microphone but this can be changed anytime on your Podcast Settings page. Select ""Change"" to upload a logo that matches your brand."
Where does my podcast artwork come from?,"Your podcast artwork can appear on different parts of your publication like your homepage and the episode page.

However, podcast artwork isn't limited to just your podcast logo and different images may appear.

Images can be pulled from various places:

Podcast artwork: This is the main logo for your podcast set on the Podcast Settings page.

Podcast artwork for paid episodes: If you have payments enabled, you can set additional artwork for paid episodes on the Podcast Settings page.

Social preview: The image you set on the Post Settings page.

Images from your post: Images that you include in the body of your post can appear as your podcast artwork.

Imported podcast artwork: If a podcast episode was imported to Substack, we'll use that podcast artwork as your Substack artwork. 

The default Substack microphone: If an image is required, we'll sometimes use the default 

Substack podcast microphone. If you upload your own podcast logo, we will never use the default.

Note: The order or precedence of the above can vary."
Where can listeners see my podcast artwork?,"At the top of an episode page, we show an image which is the same image we use in podcast players that support individual episode images (like Spotify).

The order is:

Podcast artwork for paid episodes (if the episode is paid).

Podcast artwork.

Image from the body of the post.

The default Substack microphone.

On your publication homepage, we pick the podcast artwork last and will never use the default 

Substack microphone.

The order is:

The social preview image.

Image from the body of the post.

Podcast artwork for paid episodes.

Podcast artwork (unless you have the default Substack microphone as a logo).

If none of the above are available and we need to show an image, a gray box will appear."
Understanding your Substack Podcast dashboard,"On your Podcast tab, you can see overall data on how your podcast is performing:

Average downloads 7/30/90 days after publishing an episode

Daily and cumulative downloads

Total downloads for each episode

Top countries and top players your audience is using

Overview

The Overview shows total and average downloads 7/30/90 days after publishing an episode.

Note: Total downloads are how many times a listener has downloaded or streamed an episode on their device via a web post or a podcast player. Any podcasts apps or players that use your Substack RSS feed as the source will be included.


Episodes

Each podcast episode also has a corresponding Substack post which you can view on the Posts tab. Click to expand the post and see view and open rates (if sent as an email) as well as any subscriptions gained after listening to that episode."
What is the difference between views and downloads?,"Readers can view a post by going to your Substack publication on the web and never stream the episode. Alternatively, listeners can download or stream an episode via their podcast player and never view the post. 

These are two different stats."
How do I listen to episodes on my podcast app?,"If you're subscribed as a listener to a publication, you can listen to episodes directly on your favorite podcast app."
How do I get started?,"Access your private podcast feed URL anytime on the settings page for your subscription.

You can add the publication to your app using a link you receive via email or you can manually add the feed URL to your app. 

Using a link sent via email (on your phone)

1. In the podcast setup email you receive from Substack, click on ""Add to podcast app"" and a new tab will open on your browser.

Note: If you tap your preferred podcast app and it does not load, please try manually adding the podcast feed URL to the app itself.

2. Select your podcast app and your unique private RSS feed should automatically populate in the show URL box.

I signed up for a newsletter but am not receiving any emails. What can I do?,"If you've signed up for a newsletter and haven't received your first email or you've been receiving emails and suddenly they've stopped coming, don't fret! Here are some trouble-shooting tips to help you get emails again from your favorite Substack writers.

Try testing your email address
To test whether your email delivery is working for a publication:

1. Navigate to https://publicationname.substack.com/account/email-test

You'll need to replace ""publication name"" with the name of the writer's Substack.

For example, if a newsletter you subscribe to is ""Skyline Trails"", enter the following URL:

https://skylinetrails.substack.com/account/email-test.

2. Log into the publication and select, ""Send test email"".

Check your email settings

If you have Gmail, check your Promotions tab. If a newsletter is in that section, move it to your Primary inbox.

Make sure that your email address on file is correct.

Check your spam folder to see if emails have gone there. If so, make sure to ""mark as not spam"" in your email client.

Add the publication's Substack email address to your contact list. All posts will be sent from this address: [subdomain]@substack.com. Replace 'subdomain' with the name of the publication. 

Send an email to the publication's Substack email address. This can often cause intermediate email filters to allow incoming messages.

If you are on a corporate or government email account, talk to your IT department and tell them to whitelist the publication's Substack email address.They often have email filters that are out of your individual control and can quickly resolve the issue.

There may be an email block

Go to your Substack account and see if there's an ""Email block"" message from Substack.

Follow the instructions on how to clear the email block.

If you're still not receiving any Substack emails, contact our Support team here.

If you’re looking for guidance on preparing a counterclaim, we think that the guide produced by Github is a good one. 

Upon receipt of a counterclaim, Substack must notify the complaining party and send them a copy of your counterclaim. The complaining party then has 10 days to file a legal action in court and send Substack evidence that it has done so. 

If you file a counterclaim and the complaining party fails to provide Substack evidence of a pending court case within ten days, Substack will re-publish the disputed content. 

The decision to file a counter notification is yours alone. Keep in mind that while a counter notification may result in the reactivation of your post,  the rightsholder in question may instead respond by filing a lawsuit. Please note that Substack has adopted a repeat infringer policy that will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the user accounts of repeat copyright infringers.

What do I do if my Substack work is being plagiarized on another platform?,"Plagiarism, Copyright, and You

What to do when your work’s been copied

So someone’s taken your article, copied and pasted it, and slapped their name on it elsewhere on the web. You’ve asked them to take down your work to no avail. What’s a writer to do? It’s probably a good idea to talk to a lawyer (more on that below), but we’ve compiled some useful information here to help get you situated.

Your First Stop: Shaming

Falsely claiming authorship of someone else’s writing is plagiarism. It’s not always unlawful, but it’s very often wrongful — the type of bad act that damages reputations and careers. When your plagiarist is a big name or has a big platform, calling them out might be enough to resolve your problem. You get the recognition you deserve; your plagiarist gets the scorn they’ve got coming.

Next Up: Copyright

But many times you’re not dealing with a big name, or someone with any shame at all. The good news is that copying someone else’s writing, as plagiarists tend to do, will often be copyright infringement. Copyright infringement is against the law, and copyright owners have a variety of legal tools at their disposal to help fix it. 

Copyright ownership happens automatically and instantly; it’s a right you get when you create original work. Thanks to copyright treaties, most people in the world get rights in most countries — no paperwork required.

Takedowns and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

Platforms have a strong incentive to remove content when they receive a valid copyright takedown notice (often called a “DMCA notice” after the U.S. law). Find a platform’s copyright policy and send a notice that meets their requirements — this will be enough to see content removed from many reputable hosts. If your infringer is on Substack, let us know ASAP!

Delisting on Google

Even when the host platform doesn’t respond to a takedown notice, Google Search (and other search engines) might. This doesn’t remove anything from the internet, but it can make the offending content less visible in search results. Google provides a form where you can submit a DMCA notice here. 

Finally: Legal Action

Depending on the details, your infringer might be on the hook for significant money damages. Talking to a lawyer is the first step to thinking through whether a legal claim is worth it. 

A word to U.S. writers: whether or not you have already registered your work with the Copyright Office might be make-or-break on whether it’s worth your time to go to court. Copyright is automatic, but the U.S. has rules that disadvantage copyright owners who don’t register their work with the U.S. Copyright Office. For Americans, registration is a requirement before suing for infringement, and doing it early is key to securing the right to “statutory damages” — something that can be essential to the financial viability of a lawsuit. 

Registering everything you write individually probably won’t make practical or financial sense, but there are bulk registration options and for that certain special piece, the minor inconvenience and small filing fee might be worth it.

You might have limited options

The internet is vast, and it can be expensive to enforce your rights. Different countries have different laws and different commitments to the rule of law. Ever met someone with a harddrive full of torrented Hollywood movies? The same realities that make it hard for big industry players to stave off infringement are going to make it difficult for you as well. Depending on where your infringer is based, practical options might be limited. Still, don’t assume you don’t have any options — many writers get their plagiarists to take content down or pay damages every year.

How long can I keep my subdomain?,"Writers can keep a Substack domain indefinitely so long as their publication remains active.

If a publication is inactive for more than three months and its subdomain is requested by another publisher, our policy is to ask the publisher for permission to reassign the subdomain ([name].substack.com) to the requester.

We may reassign a subdomain at any time at our discretion if we believe that the use of the subdomain poses a security risk to our platform, employees, or users.

Please note that we may decide to reassign a subdomain without a holder’s explicit permission if we believe the holder is exploiting the subdomain with no intention to become an active platform participant or publisher.

In order to keep any subdomain, activity on your publication should be authentic. We reserve the right to use our discretion when evaluating whether content has been published for the sole purpose of domain squatting."
